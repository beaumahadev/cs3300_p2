A. There are two main categories of data we have:
    - Data of defense expenditures of countries from 1988-2016
    - Data of wars with many participating countries from 1988-2016
    First Data: We got the first data from _________. There are t
    Second Data: We got the information on each wars and their description from Wikipedia.
    The variables include: War names, Start year, End Year, Winning countries, losing countries, and a very breif historical background on each wars. If we were to reformat the data, we would get rid of all spaces such as "South Korea" to "SouthKorea", also, we would produce a data that would indicate whether the winning countries spend more money or the losing countries in a war.
    We integrated the first data and the second data by creating a "donut" data with a interactive design in which when a user hovers over a war, it would light up the participating countries and the circle of the sizes will pop up in the middle in accordance to the magnitude of their spending.
    ADDITIONAL DATA:
    the second visual we have is title "Military Spending Over Time". It is a line graph with two variables: Domestic Military Spending, and Year. It shows the comparison of military spending color-categorized by continents and it shows that the United States' spending far outspends than rest of the world in their military spending.
    the third visual we have is titled "Top Military Spenders"
