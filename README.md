A. There are two main categories of data we have:
    - Data of defense expenditures of countries from 1988-2016
    - Data of wars with many participating countries from 1988-2016
    First Data: We got the first data from https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex, which is a website of Stockholm International Peace Research Institue. On their website, they had a full excel file of all the military expenditures of countries (categorized by continents) from 1988 to 2016. The variables are country, region, and all the years from 1990 to 2016.
    Second Data: We got the information on each wars and their description from Wikipedia.
    The variables include: War names, Start year, End Year, Winning countries, losing countries, and a very breif historical background on each wars. If we were to reformat the data, we would get rid of all spaces such as "South Korea" to "SouthKorea", also, we would produce a data that would indicate whether the winning countries spend more money or the losing countries in a war.
    How We Integrated: We integrated the first data into one file by putting all the continents into one. and the second data by creating a "donut" data with a interactive design in which when a user hovers over a war, it would light up the participating countries and the circle of the sizes will pop up in the middle in accordance to the magnitude of their spending. We would match of the years and the most significant war of that year and map the expenditures to the war.

C. The main idea of our interactive project is to show how much America has invested on military spending-- even in the countries that were seemingly unrelated to the United States. In our first visual "donut" data, when you hover over a war, the united states pop up as the biggest circle the majority of the time.
    the second visual we have is title "Military Spending Over Time". It is a line graph with two variables: Domestic Military Spending, and Year. It shows the comparison of military spending color-categorized by continents and it shows that the United States' spending far outspends than rest of the world in their military spending.
    the third visual we have is titled "Top Military Spenders" which compares the American military spending to the other countries of the top ten top military spenders in the world.
    the two supplemental visuals serve for the common purpose of demonstrating that the United States' spending far exceeds than rest of the world in their military spending.
